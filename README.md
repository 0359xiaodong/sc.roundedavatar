sc.roundedavatar
================

Titanium module to that creates a rounded representation of the original image. The original image is expected to be square (see example app).
This module can be used to create rounded avatars (hence the name) such as those seen in the Google+ application as well as all over iOS7.

The module was created with inspiration and help from this blog post and its author: http://evel.io/2013/07/21/rounded-avatars-in-android/
